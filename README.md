# FIFA19DreamTeam
In this project, we are analysing the dataset corresponding to FIFA19 players.
The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19/download). The dataset after performing some basic cleaning is included in the repository.

The **aim** of this project is to perform basic data profiling, calculating some basic statistics, dealing with duplicate and missing values, sorting data, normalization of data, performing basic exploratory data analysis and to extract a team of top 11 players.
